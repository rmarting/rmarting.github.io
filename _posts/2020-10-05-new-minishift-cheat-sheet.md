Is OpenShift 3 "legacy" :older_woman: :older_man:? Maybe, however in some organizations
is already the current [Platform as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)
deployed and running in production.

From time to time I have to work on that platform, reviewing deployments, architectures, or
designing migration approaches to OpenShift 4 using operators. Whatever it is the cause,
I need to run locally an OpenShift 3 cluster, and here
[minishift](https://docs.okd.io/3.11/minishift/getting-started/index.html) helps me a lot ... so:

:tada: I am pleasure to announce that a new Cheat Sheet is available :tada:

* [Minishift Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/minishift)

I hope this new cheat sheet helps you when you need to install, deploy and operate your 
own local OpenShift 3 cluster.

My full list of Cheat Sheets are available for your records [here](/cheat-sheets). As usual,
comments, ideas, PRs are welcomed!

Happy reading !!! :books:
