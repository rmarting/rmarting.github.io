As you know :smirk: my blog is a small place in Internet, to share my knowledge, experience, how-to, ...
or whatever related with software development, computing, Open Source, platforms, Operating
Systems and anything I learn everyday in my job. 

To spread it :wave: to a wide audience :family: I joined to [dev.to](https://dev.to)
to republish some content there. It is similar as I did when I joined
to [diff.blog()](/2020/10/20/my-blog-in-diff-blog). I hope :pray: this new integration
helps me to achieve it. At the end I am looking for to get more feedback, comments,
ideas or suggestions in my blog posts to create better content.

So from now my [profile in dev.to](https://dev.to/rmarting) is ready to you. I am excited
to analyze how is going to work in the next weeks.

Have fun navigating in [dev.to](https://dev.to/rmarting)! :sailboat:
