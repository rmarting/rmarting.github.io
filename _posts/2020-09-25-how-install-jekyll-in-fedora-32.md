[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
to build, deploy and publish your Blog Site easily. Using Jekyll, you can blog using
beautiful Markdown syntax, and without having to deal with any databases.

[Roman's Blog](https://rmarting.github.io) is published using this amazing technology, however
my first steps were not easy. 

To use it basically means to execute the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
❯ gem install bundler jekyll
❯ jekyll new rmarting.github.io
❯ cd rmarting.github.io
❯ bundle exec jekyll serve
   Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
{% endhighlight %}

However the reality was not so easy. This blog post described the steps done to install and use
on my Fedora 32.

## Installation errors

This simple command was a nightmare:

{% highlight bash %}
>  gem install bundler jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

Because I found so many installation errors such as:

{% highlight bash %}
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    current directory: /home/rmarting/.gem/ruby/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7/ext
/usr/bin/ruby -I /usr/share/rubygems -r ./siteconf20200925-983033-i0nt3z.rb extconf.rb
mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /usr/share/include/ruby.h

You might have to install separate package for the ruby development
environment, ruby-dev or ruby-devel for example.

extconf failed, exit code 1

Gem files will remain installed in /home/rmarting/.gem/ruby/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7 for inspection.

1 gem installed
{% endhighlight %}

And:

{% highlight bash %}
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    current directory: /home/rmarting/.gem/ruby/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7/ext

Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.

To see why this extension failed to compile, please check the mkmf.log which can be found here:

{% endhighlight %}

And this other one:

{% highlight bash %}
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing jekyll:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    current directory: /home/rmarting/.gem/ruby/gems/eventmachine-1.2.7/ext

1 gem installed
{% endhighlight %}

## Prepare your Fedora 32

After some researching (ok, googling it) I found that you need to install something else that **ruby**. The
final list of dependencies you have to install is:

{% highlight bash %}
❯ sudo dnf install rubygems ruby-devel gcc rpm-build gcc-c++ make zlib-devel
{% endhighlight %}

Then you could come back to the original commands to execute locally your GitHub pages:

{% highlight bash %}
❯ gem install bundler jekyll
❯ bundle exec jekyll serve
   Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
{% endhighlight %}

Enjoy it!
