[Cheat Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet) :bookmark: are a concise set of notes :pencil:
used for a quick reference. Many enterprise products, community projects and systems provide them to help and
ease the life of their users :couple:.

After many time :calendar: working with some projects, I have created my own cheet sheets for different projects
and products I use in my daily work. I share them here for anyone that needs a quick reference on some
of the following items:

* :bookmark: [ActiveMQ Artemis Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/activemq-artemis)
* :bookmark: [Apache Kafka Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/apache-kafka)
* :bookmark: [Strimzi Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/strimzi)
* :bookmark: [Code Ready Containers](/cheat-sheets/crc)

I hope :pray: you find them useful. Feel free to use or improve them
following my [contribution guide](/contributing).
